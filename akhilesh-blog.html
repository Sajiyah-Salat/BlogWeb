                One of the things you often hear from people is, “Oh, programming is easy. Every beginner, everybody can do it. If you’re an 8-year-old, or you are a 60-year-old, everybody can learn to code and it’s super easy.” And my response to that is that is really really irresponsible for people to say this because, quite honestly, programming is hard. Like don’t fool yourself, and don’t listen to people who say like, “Oh yeah, it’s so easy.” Yeah maybe like the first part when you first create a variable and add 2 to it that’s easy. But actually being able to master code is not easy. It’s definitely not easy. And you know, you can’t think like, “Oh why is it that everybody saying it’s so easy, but I’m finding it so hard? Does that mean I’m dumb?” It’s not true. It’s a hard thing you’re doing. And just by getting this far, you’ve really shown what you are made of.

                But you know, the other sort of side where people flip to you as well is like, “Programming is impossible. Like you either have to be a genius or you are not going to get it.” And that’s not true either, because, very often I look at people, students who say like, “You are so great, I can’t be like you.” But, there is nothing that anybody has in you.
                
                If you go on YouTube and look at all the developers who take about, a day in the life of a developer, if you look at those people, the is no difference between these developers who have learned it and you.
                
                Like nobody is better than anybody.
                
                It’s just the amount that somebody has put in. If you put in more work you end up with more results. That’s all it is.
                
                So, don’t be fooled by these two things people say: programming is easy or programming is really hard and impossible. They’re both not true. Programming is hard, but it’s doable, and it’s doable but you, as long as you keep going like you have been. They are going to get there. And I believe in you.
                
                So keep hitting and we’re going to do great.
